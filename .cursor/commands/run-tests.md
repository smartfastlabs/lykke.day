# Make Test Command

Run the command `make test` in the terminal.

If any errors occur, do **not** just "fix the failing line" or silence the symptom. Diagnose and explain the underlying root cause first, then implement a fix that addresses that root cause.

If the root-cause fix would require a large or wide-reaching change, explain the proposed approach and impact first, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.
