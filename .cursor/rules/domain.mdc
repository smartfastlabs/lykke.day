# Domain Layer Overview

The Domain layer contains pure business logic with **zero external dependencies**. It defines the core business model, entities, value objects, and domain events.

---

## Layer Structure

```
domain/
├── entities/          # Business objects (aggregate roots)
├── value_objects/     # Immutable value types
├── events/            # Domain events
└── services/          # Pure domain services (no I/O)
```

---

## Import Rules

**Allowed Imports:**

- Standard library (e.g., `datetime`, `uuid`, `enum`)
- Type checking imports (`TYPE_CHECKING`, `Protocol`, etc.)
- `planned.core.exceptions` - Base exception classes
- Other domain layer modules

**Forbidden Imports:**

- `planned.application.*` - Application layer
- `planned.infrastructure.*` - Infrastructure layer
- `planned.presentation.*` - Presentation layer
- Database/framework libraries (SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, etc.)
- HTTP/external API libraries

**Exception:** `core.exceptions` is allowed because it contains only base exception classes with no business logic or dependencies.

## Subdirectories

### Entities (`domain/entities/`)

**Purpose:** Business objects with identity and lifecycle. All entities are aggregate roots.

**Location:** `backend/planned/domain/entities/`

**Key Components:**

- `base.py` - BaseEntityObject, BaseDateObject
- Entity classes (TaskEntity, DayEntity, UserEntity, etc.)

**What It Does:**

- Represents business objects with identity
- Enforces business rules and invariants
- Emits domain events for important changes
- Contains business logic methods

**For Details:** See `.cursor/rules/domain-entities.mdc`

---

### Value Objects (`domain/value_objects/`)

**Purpose:** Immutable value types with no identity. Represent concepts in the domain.

**Location:** `backend/planned/domain/value_objects/`

**Key Components:**

- `base.py` - BaseValueObject, BaseRequestObject, BaseResponseObject
- `query.py` - Query objects (DateQuery, etc.)
- `update.py` - Update objects (TaskUpdateObject, etc.)
- Value object classes (TaskStatus, TaskCategory, etc.)

**What It Does:**

- Represents immutable values
- Provides type safety for domain concepts
- Used for filtering, searching, and updates
- No business logic, just data structures

**For Details:** See `.cursor/rules/domain-value-objects.mdc`

---

### Events (`domain/events/`)

**Purpose:** Domain events that represent something important that happened in the domain.

**Location:** `backend/planned/domain/events/`

**Key Components:**

- `base.py` - DomainEvent, EntityCreatedEvent, EntityUpdatedEvent, EntityDeletedEvent
- Event classes (TaskCompletedEvent, TaskStatusChangedEvent, etc.)

**What It Does:**

- Represents important domain occurrences
- Carries context about what happened
- Immutable and timestamped
- Collected and dispatched after transaction commit

**For Details:** See `.cursor/rules/domain-events.mdc`

---

### Services (`domain/services/`)

**Purpose:** Pure domain services with no I/O operations. Business logic that doesn't belong to a single entity.

**Location:** `backend/planned/domain/services/`

**Key Components:**

- Service classes (NotificationService, RoutineService, etc.)

**What It Does:**

- Contains pure business logic
- Operates on domain entities and value objects
- No database, HTTP, or file system access
- Deterministic and side-effect free

**For Details:** See `.cursor/rules/domain-services.mdc`

---

## Adding a New Feature

When adding a new feature in the domain layer:

1. **Add entities** - Add or update entities in `entities/` with business methods
2. **Add value objects** - Add or update value objects in `value_objects/` if needed
3. **Add domain events** - Add domain events in `events/` if needed
4. **Add domain services** - Add domain services in `services/` if logic doesn't belong to an entity

**Where to look:**

- Entity patterns: `planned/domain/entities/base.py`
- Value object patterns: `planned/domain/value_objects/base.py`
- Event patterns: `planned/domain/events/base.py`
- Existing entities: `planned/domain/entities/`
- Existing value objects: `planned/domain/value_objects/`

---

## Common Patterns

### Entity Pattern

- All entities are aggregate roots
- Entities extend `BaseEntityObject`
- Business logic in entity methods
- Entities emit domain events via `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`

### Value Object Pattern

- Value objects are immutable (`frozen=True`)
- Use enums for fixed sets (TaskStatus, TaskCategory, etc.)
- Query objects extend `BaseQuery`
- Update objects extend `BaseUpdateObject`

### Domain Event Pattern

- Events are immutable and timestamped
- Events extend `DomainEvent`
- Standard events: `EntityCreatedEvent`, `EntityUpdatedEvent`, `EntityDeletedEvent`
- Custom events extend `DomainEvent` for domain-specific events

---

## Testing

Domain layer tests go in `tests/unit/domain/`:

- Test entities in isolation (no mocking needed)
- Test value objects behavior
- Test domain services as pure functions
- Test business rules and invariants
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple scenarios

**For detailed testing guidance:** See subdirectory-specific rules.
