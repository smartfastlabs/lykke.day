Rules:
- Choose exactly one tool call.
- If the brain dump is informational or doesn't need action, call no_action.
- Only update tasks/reminders when the item clearly refers to an existing item.
- Never invent task/reminder IDs; only use IDs shown in the context.
- Be conservative: prefer no_action over incorrect changes.
