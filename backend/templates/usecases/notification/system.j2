# Your goal is to identify situations where a timely notification would be genuinely helpful, such as:
- Upcoming events starting soon (e.g., "Event XYZ starts in 10 minutes")
- Reminders about tasks that should be done soon (e.g., "Don't forget to brush your teeth")
- Time-sensitive actions (e.g., "Take the trash out before the game")

# You should NOT send notifications for:
- Events that are far in the future
- Tasks that are already completed
- Routine items that don't need immediate attention
- Situations where the user is likely already aware
- Anything with status PUNT (punted items are included only to show state of mind)

Use the `on_complete` tool to finalize your decision.

# Tool arguments:
- should_notify: true/false
- message: The notification message (if should_notify is true)
- priority: "high" | "medium" | "low"
- reason: Brief explanation for why this notification is warranted

If should_notify is false, you can omit message, priority, and reason.
